# Core Project Statement:

_First of all, Thanks for joining me on my journey!_

## The Concept:

My ideas. For my project I want to go very experimental. Try something new and combine it with the things I have seen in my course at Howest over the past years.

My eye fell on live programming of music. As several people practice this I want to go and look deeper at how they do this and with what programs.

As I found Alex McLean online I got introduced to how it works and with what programs they work. So I installed SuperCollider and got working with TidalCycles in VSCode.


A friend of mine talked about an opera piece called ‘_Einstein on the beach_’ where the audiance is the piece. There is no story or structure in the story.

I want to make a website with the live structure of a part of the musicpiece where it adjusts accordingly to your mood.


The music and the mood will be supported by visuals by Hydra. So that my end result as the musicpiece will have the audience’s experience as result.

## Deliverables:

Live musicresult with visuals.
