De Klant: mezelf

Core Project Statement:

My ideas. For my project I want to go very experimental. Try something new and combine it with the things I have seen in my course at Howest over the past years.

My eye fell on live programming of music. As several people practice this I want to go and look deeper at how they do this and with what programs.

As I found Alex McLean online I got introduced to how it works and with what programs they work. So I installed SuperCollider and got working with tidal.

I'm gonna look deeper into connecting C# or Javascript to Tidal. When this will be possible I would like to connect my visuals to the loops.

More in depth explanation coming soon...

Deliverables:
A complete 'set of tidalloops connected with my C#/ Javascript and visuals
