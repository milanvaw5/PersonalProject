# Core Project Statement:

_First of all, Thanks for joining me on my journey!_

## The Concept:
My idea; for my project I want to go very experimental. Try something new and combine it with the things I have seen in my course at Howest over the past years.

My eye fell on live programming of music. As several people practice this I want to go and look deeper at how they do this and with what programs.

As I found Alex McLean online I got introduced to how it works and with what programs they work. So I installed SuperCollider and got working with TidalCycles in Atom.

A friend of mine talked about an opera piece called ‘Einstein on the beach’ where the audiance is the piece. After the show they would ask people what there experience was, their own personal answer is the result. There is no story or structure in the story.

I want to make a live performance with music with different interpretations of emotions.

The sounds/interpretation will be supported by visuals from Hydra. So that my end result as the musicpiece will have the audience’s experience as result.

With this I want to answer this question: "Can I work out my emotional interpretation of a non-programming related subject and pass this to others by code?"

Beside the result I was very excited to explore the possibilities with TidalCycles and Hydra and try to push my own boundaries.

## Deliverables:

Live musicresult with visuals.
