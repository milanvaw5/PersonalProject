De Klant: myself

Core Project Statement:

My ideas. For my project I want to go very experimental. Try something new and combine it with the things I have seen in my course at Howest over the past years.

My eye fell on live programming of music. As several people practice this I want to go and look deeper at how they do this and with what programs.

As I found Alex McLean online I got introduced to how it works and with what programs they work. So I installed SuperCollider and got working with tidal.

A friend of mine talked about an opera piece called ‘Einstein on the beach’ where the audiance is the piece. There is no story or structure in the story.

I want to make a website with the live structure of a part of the pusicpeace where you can adjust your mood and it plays according to what you have chosen.

The music and the mood will be supported by visuals. So that my website as the musicpiece will have the audience's experience as result.

Deliverables:

A website
